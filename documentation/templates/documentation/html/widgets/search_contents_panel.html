		  <h4>Faceting & Browsing through the database - langing page</h4>
	  
		  <p>You can browse the PhIS database using facets. The facets allow you to drill down to the desired results without having to type in the main search box. Exploring the database in this manner can commence from either the landing page or search page. From the index page, clicking on points on the charts makes you navigate to the search page where results are displayed for your selection. These charts are canned queries that present the visual summaries of the datasets within PhenoImageShare database.</p>
	  
		  <br />
		  <h6>Browsing from landing page</h6>
		  <p>Clicking on points on the charts takes you to the search page where the corresponding records are displayed based on applied filters (selected point on chart).</p>
	  
		  <p>The screenshot below shows a clicking-through of points corresponding to Mutants-Phenotype sample/image field types on charts on the index page.</p>

		  <h6>Browsing using facets (checkboxes & freetext inputs)</h6>
		  <p>PhIS database can be browsed and/or filtered using the facets provided on the search page. Facets and subfacets allow quick navigation to the records of interest by checking applicable facet boxes or making an ontology-based faceted search (e.g for Gene, Anatomy, or Phenotype using facets equivalents). Clicking on the top-level facets (such as Mutants, Wildtype, Imaging method, or Development stage) will open up subfilters (such as Expression or Phenotype subfacets of Mutants / Wiltype main facets). Checking or ticking a subfacet of interest will return and display a narrowed result set based on selected field values.</p>

		  <p>The screenshot below shows returned records for Mutant-Phenotype selection followed by faceted search for <b><i>Fam73b</i></b> gene.</p>

	  <h4>Search & Browse the PhenoImageShare Repository - search page</h4>
	  <p>PhenoImageShare (PhIS) allows freetext search through its database. It presently supports filtering of search results based on eight data types, namely Sample and Image types, Imaging method, Developmental stage, Anatomy, Gene and Phenotype. </p>
	  <p>To begin, you can browse the PhIS repository using the filters or perform a freetext search or combine these. You can also combine these search facilities. Freetext could range from a gene or gene symbol, phenotype description or anatomy term. Facets have top and second levels, with the second level ones being the data filters. Each top level data type has 1 or more subfacets which allows for data filtering.</p>
	  
	  <br/>
	
	  <h6>Freetext search - phenotype term search</h6>
	  <p>As user begins to type in the main input field of the search interface, a list of autosuggested terms is provided. Selecting a value from this list and clicking the "Search" button will return results that match search terms. Figure below shows a freetext search for phenotype term "abnormal hair cycle".</p>
	  
	  <p><a href="{% static 'documentation/images/phenotype_abnormal_hair_cycle.png' %}" title="Phenotype term search - for abnormal hair cycle" class="lightbox"><img src="{% static 'documentation/images/phenotype_abnormal_hair_cycle.png' %}" width="650" height="450" alt="Single Image"/ ></a></p>
	  
	  <br/>
	  
	  <h6>Freetext search & facet controls - gene search, data filtering </h6>
	  <p>Following a search, results can be filtered using the facets. The figure below shows a freetext search for a gene <b><i>Stx8</i></b> followed by filtering based on Sample/Image types (e.g. Mutant/Expression) and the Development stage (e.g. postnatal).</p>
	  
  	  <p> Results from gene search can be filtered by opening any of the facets for which data exists (i.e., non-zero facet count), and ticking any of the filters under the facet.</p>
