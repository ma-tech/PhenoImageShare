	  <h4>Detail View</h4>
	  <p>PhenoImageShare detail view presents an expanded view of selected image, along with its metadata. A high resolution version of the image is displayed along with its genotype information and metadata. Associated annotations - phenotype, anatomical and/or freetext - are also displayed in this view. The detailed view allows selection of annotations of interest, while displaying them on the image. Future releases will also support addition of new annotations and/or Regions Of Interest (ROIs) from the detail view.</p>

	  <h6>Image ROIs and Annotations</h6>
	  <p>When it comes to displaying the regions of interest and annotations associated with the image, you are provided with two options. Clicking on an annotation record in the <b><i>"ROI & Annotations"</i></b> panel displays details of the selected annotation. Similar information is shown in a pop-up box that appears when you hover over an annotation. In future releases, you will be able to display similar information when you over over the image.  </p>
