	  <h4>Image genotype-phenotype detail</h4>
	  <p>PhenoImageShare detail view presents an expanded view of image of interest along with its metadata. High resolution version of the image is displayed along with its genotype information and associated metadata. Associated annotations - phenotype, anatomical and freetext - are also displayed in this view. Detailed view supports various user interations, ranging from allowing selection of annotations of interest through to display them on the image and adding new annotations and/or ROIs.</p>

Clicking on an annotation record in the <b><i>"ROI & Annotations"</i></b> panel displays details of annotation. Hovering over a line of ROI/Annotation, a pop-up appears showing similar information. In future similar feature will be provided by hovering of the sections of the image.  </p>
