<h5>What is PhenoImageShare?</h5>

<p>PhenoImageShare is a cross-species, cross-repository tool enabling
semantic discovery, browsing and annotation of phenotypical
images.</p>

<br/>	 
<h5>Cross-repository?</h5>

<p>Today tools like <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero">OMERO</a>
make it easy for researchers to roll their own repository. These
repositories are isolated; there is no single way of searching,
browsing and/or annotating the images they contain. PhenoImageShare is building a mechanism to enable semantic discovery and annotation across a variety of underlying image repositories.</p>

<br/>	 
<h5>What is your definition of <strong>phenotype</strong>?</h5>

<p>Our definition is broad. We include normal and abnormal. Gene
expression, histopathology &#8230;</p>

<br/>	 
<h5>Do you just work with mouse images?</h5>

<p>No, we just haven&#8217;t got round to the other species. We plan
to include zebrafish, drosophila and perhaps plants too.</p>

<br/>	 
<h5>Who funds PhenoImageShare?</h5>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk">BBSRC</a> under BBR grant BB/K019937/1.</p>

<br/>	 
<h5>Who works on PhenoImageShare?</h5>

<p>PhenoImageShare is a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/people/r.baldock.html">MRC Human
Genetics Unit</a>, the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/helen-parkinson">Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies team</a> at the EMBL-EBI and <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/bisel">Heriot-Watt University</a>.</p>
